# dadbot3000

dadBot3000 is an RShiny app displaying texts generated by a Markov model built on texts sent to me by my dad – it was a gift for his 60th birthday.

## `setup/`
* `build_and_generate.R` – contains the code that builds a Markov model and generates texts, as well as some testing code that was used to determine reasonable limits on the app's inputs. Once those limits were determined, a model was built for every possible combination of inputs, and resulting texts were saved to `RDS` files for the app to read.

## `dadbot3000/`
* `data/` – pre-generated data for the app to use (creaeted by `setup/build_and_generate.R`)
* `images/` – contains the robot image used in the app
* `www/` – custom css for this app
* `app.R` – shockingly, this is the code for the app (both UI and server)
