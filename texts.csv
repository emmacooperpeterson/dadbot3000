Pretty cool 😎 
Rotatoes!
You may have read this already but this is quite good.
"Wow 😳.  Yeah stuff gets ripped off constantly and it can be a gray area and hard to prove or enforce anything, unfortunately for artists."
"Exactly!  Very common practice to say, “We want something just like this 👉”. "
We are getting pummeled by rain/wind/thunder 😬
Haven’t seen this one before 🤔
I saw that.  What a crushing finish for Wolves ☹️. I did not agree with the call.
That goal was amazing 😳
"Just watched Nanette.  Smart, vulnerable, powerful. Amazing writing. Thank you for recommending it ❤️"
My pizza toppings tonight 😋
Boca veggie crumbles in frozen aisle?  Where have you gotten it?
Just looked at Target.  👎 
Going to Whole Foods now 🤞
Target has Morningstar stuff.  Ended up getting Morningstar veggies crumbles at Target and Beyond Meat crumbles at Whole Foods.  Didn’t find Boca 🤔
The sloppiest of Joes and also tacos.  Not tonight though.
Red Stars games are on Twitch? 🤷‍♂️
"Red Stars need to maintain possession for more than 10 seconds, preferably not in their own half 🤔"
That’s what I thought.  I’m not going to last much longer 💤 
Can they win without me?
Beyond Meat crumbles have been eliminated in the first round.  Didn’t like the look (looks like Rosie’s food) or texture.  We made tacos with it and it was the weakest link 😐
Wow 😳. With that kind of firepower I hope they invest in the league as a whole and use their well-earned name recognition to promote it.  Very interesting.
Very clip arty.  If nothing else they need to vary the weight of the lines.  Make the type bold and maybe the ring under the type is black and the type is white/bold.  🤷‍♂️
"With everything being thin, no one thing really stands out."
That looks like something I might like.  Thank you 😊 
Have you gotten to this part of your knee rehab yet?
"I forgot I sent this so when I saw “almost there” I was momentarily excited by the thought that you were coming to see us 😬.  Oh well, I’m also excited that you’re almost back to doing back flips."
"A woman asked on Twitter for recommendations for a video game where she can just walk around, saying, “I don’t want to fight or figure things out.  I just want to...walk around.”  I don’t know if you’ve played these but a lot of people seem to like A Short Hike and Stardew Valley."
I can do that but I’m not sure when I’ll get to it.  I’m working this weekend 😞

That woman said she’s played a lot of that game that you like (name escapes me 😬)
Animal crossing!! 🤦‍♂️
I had the option to work but I’m getting time and a half so...here I am
Have you heard Taylor Swift / Bon Iver “exile”? I don’t generally listen to Taylor Swift but I liked this.  Just came up on one of the music channels.  Bon Iver’s voice is so good.
"Yeah, I didn’t mind her voice in this but Bon Iver definitely carries the song.  "
He sings in the beginning of the song in a way I hadn’t heard him before.  Made me think “who is this?” You’ve listened to more of him than I have.
"Yeah, I really liked his voice in that"
I meant the Taylor Swift song but I really like 8 (circle) too
Having a hard time navigating this site in the car but it might help you figure out what’s planned 
That’s good to hear.  We drove out of it pretty quickly.
Pizza still going to be 5ish more minutes 
We stopped at the Mini dealership in Indianapolis on the way home so Mom could drool on an all-electric Mini and got to Rosie with 15 minutes to spare before they closed.
"You’re probably familiar with Gabrielle Blair because she’s had a number of things go viral on Twitter.  If you’re not familiar, you may find her to be a good follow on Twitter and Instagram (more design/less politics)."
That’s super creepy 😤. It looks like a creepy old guy with no background in or understanding of soccer who clearly views the players he “owns” as property to be sold (like the real estate he bought and sold) and obviously hires men who have the same view.  I know they need people with lots of money to finance the teams but the league needs to purge those guys.
I’m assuming you’ve seen Becky Sauerbrunn’s response to that story?
I agree ☝️ 
Does he have a trailer full of fruit 🤔

Is there any reason why you can’t be doing that right now?
It’s also kind of irresponsible.  All that electricity right next to the pool 😬 ⚡️

"It is, all kidding aside, pretty amazing."
2nd time this week.  We may have over cheesed 😬 🧀 
Agreed 😋
+ Aleppo pepper on mine
Did you see this little peanut?
"I’m holding off, reluctantly stomping my feet like a toddler, annoyed by their predictable move to extract more money out of me.  I’m sure I’ll have to give in at some point."

Kinda killing me to not be able to see this one in particular 
I was excited to see that Salah had scored but then somewhat deflated when I saw it was a pk.  I’ll take it but I would have rather it happened from “normal” play.
I think I tend to disagree with half of all pk calls.  I guess I’d be a bad ref.
I’m going to be outside doing some yard work.  Don’t let anything bad happen.

Very pleased to see your first juggles by the way 🥰
Are you expecting a check from PayPal?
I cheated and opened it 😬.  I could tell there was one of those fake paper credit cards in there so I figured it was promotional.

You guessed it - it was an offer for a business loan.
Hmm 🤔 
Possession is 9/10 of the law
Nobody wants that 🤢
I’m excited to see that!  Can we open the cutters to have a peek?
"Ignoring how old and tired I look (am)😒, what do you think of these?  First is a bit rounder than I usually wear and second is very close to my current glasses 🤓 "
I took these pictures myself at the eye doctor today so 😷
Round ones huh 🤔 
"Sorta, kinda, round-ish 😬"
Toes must have been getting a little toasty 
Holy moly 😳
Seemed like something you would enjoy
VAR 😡😭
"When they put the lines up I thought, phew he’s on. The announcers said, OK he was on.  Millimeters?! 🤷‍♂️"
"Here’s me with my Liverpool hat on and my mask, of course."
I’ve been outside raking leaves so I hadn’t seen the verdict on van dijk’s injury.  Makes me mad.  I know it happens but that was a reckless challenge from Pickford who should have gotten red card.  Wouldn’t change anything for van dijk but that was really bad 😞
"No, I was back to leaf wrangling "
"I like the goal line technology that lets the ref know the ball crossed the line.  Other than that, I think VAR should be used sparingly, if at all.  It seems like someone could quickly look at a replay and see that a player was very obviously offside and overrule but this constant pixel-peeping needs to stop."
We just filled out our ballots and we’re going to deliver in person this week.  Did you send your ballot?
I hope you got all the answers right.

Very exciting knee news!  That must feel good 👏💪
Look what I got for my Merry Birthday!  I love it 🥰. The color and texture are really great.  Thank you 😊 
Do you know what this is?
I guess??
Good question 
I too am unaware.  Apparently it’s being settled at this very moment so I’m assuming we’ll soon be aware 🤷‍♂️
Jimenez!
Who placed that wall 😒
I think Chicago’s a great setting for a Batman movie 😎. Very cool!  Did you and Rey figure out how to get yourselves in a shot?
Good morning 🌞 💤 
More of a donut 🍩 🎃 
"Yeah, I’m not a fan of that.  His foot was touched but he threw himself to the ground.  I don’t think the touch warranted a PK."
I did.  I agreed with the second one but not the first one.
I’m not happy about that premium peacock stealing my games 😡
I knew you weren’t eligible but they didn’t know it.  I wasn’t sure if they would just take your word for it.  I’m glad you didn’t have any trouble 😀

Did you wish Spencer a happy birthday?
Yesterday Spencer sent me a picture that he took on a bike ride and I asked him if he got a special earthquake and mountain lion resistant fireproof bike?

He said the bike is mountain lion resistant up to a certain depth and he always soaks it it kerosene before he rides.  😒
Bicycling Magazine puts out a bunch of these
"Completely agree!  Mom and I were following this last night.  His (and his team’s) response is huge.  It’s one thing to say the right thing, which is important, but to put meaningful action behind those words is amazing, and in many ways shocking.  “You’re going to walk off the field and forfeit the game!?” The attention it drew and the conversation it spurred is, again, huge.  Major, major kudos to Landon.  Get this out of the game, indeed 👏"
Pretty funny thread 👇
Kindred spirit:
"She’s currently very, very concerned about the popping noises coming from the fireplace "
It’s very loooongg lasting
I’m assuming they either want more money?
Our absentee ballots arrived today 👏
"money, money, money"
I need to do a little research myself 😬. 
I agree. 
She’s unsuccessfully attempting to not be terrified of the fire in the fireplace.  This is a fairly new phenomenon 😒
I’m watching the Bears game going on down the street from you
Bears have been...uninspiring 
There were apparently thousands of incorrect ballots sent out in Ohio.  I’m not sure what was wrong with them.  I’ll have to look into it but I think mine looks correct.

It is annoying how many unopposed Republicans are in there 😐
I think all of the “bad” ballots were in Franklin county
"Yes, honest mistake, they say."
"I’m really worried about all of the voter suppression tactics, not to mention what happens after the election 😒"
"Seems like something you might enjoy.  There’s no real goal other than building whimsical little towns.  I think it would be a laptop thing, not a phone thing."
I heard there were going to be but hadn’t heard anything about how they were going to handle it 
Here’s your new work-from-home setup:
Thought you might enjoy these:
"Not that you have issues with light but this is a nice thread of hearty, air-cleansing plants:"
Roasted vegetable lasagna 😋
Did you make it yet?
"Whether you do it this time or not, the red sauce is really good so you should get that recipe from Mom.  Great for pizza too."
Those are great 😀. Can’t decide what my favorite would be if I had to vote.
"Oh, perfect!  Thank you 😍"
Looks just like my frequent visitors!
Are you familiar with St. South?  I’ve only heard a couple of songs but you might like her.  Reminds me of Julia Stone.
Are you expecting to get an answer on the new position today?
Reaallllllyyy hoping it goes your way 🤞🤞🤞
Word 😐
Tottenham was robbed
I agree.  Tottenham outplayed Newcastle the whole game too and I think it was offside when the kick was taken.  Looked pretty clear to me when they put the grid up 🤷‍♂️
I agree.  I just thought that once they opened that door they should call it correctly.
They should really just consult us.  My phone was sitting right next to me 😒
There’s a chance this might be notice of jury duty.  Would you like me to open it?
Ding ding ding
You should call Clerk of Courts (Gary Walters) number and tell them you live in Chicago now.  

I’m not sure what they’ll need for proof but calling is a good place to start.  You’ll probably need to tell them the dates you’re scheduled and maybe your juror number.

That office will be closed right now but you should call tomorrow as soon as you can.
Let me know how it goes.  Unfortunately your phone number will show 740 area code 🤔
"With everything being thin, no one thing really stands out."
Seems like a little more thought went into that one 🤔 
Wait till design Twitter weighs in 😬
"If you still like the low key electronic, mostly instrumental stuff for background working music there’s a Spotify playlist called Organica that you might like. "
If England (and others) finally start putting serious money into women’s professional soccer it’ll be good for the players and a serious challenge for NWSL
Did you get a call from the Morgan Stanley guy?
This one is slightly snug but mostly in the length 
"Rosie is tough to fit even when she’s right in front of you for measurements.  The sizing on dog stuff seems to be all over the place to, which doesn’t help."
*TOO!!!
I’m sorry you had to see that 😞
A lot of lying going on
"What else did you make besides pie? Not that pie isn’t enough, of course."
"Seems like more stories that paint Ellis in an unflattering light will probably come out now.  I’m actually not sure how I feel about this.  There are an awful lot of very successful coaches, especially on the elite level, who were not always nice people but got the results they were after.  "

"I know there are many other players who had issues with Ellis but I was somehow oblivious to that until fairly recently.  If I remember correctly, she was pretty nasty to Alli Krieger."
Funny timing - I just got an email from US Soccer asking for a donation to the Jill Ellis scholarship fund 🤔 You probably got the same thing.

There are coaches who are very tough but fair and their players would run through brick walls for them and there are coaches who use fear and mind games to motivate their players.  Both coaches can be successful but I know which one I would rather play for.  
I don’t like the new US away jerseys 😬
I wouldn’t say I hate it 🤔
I like the back better than the front
"Ok, in combination with the socks the jersey is growing on me 😒"
Almost there 
In the lobby
The Summer of Louise ™️
"Those screws are #10, right?"
Are there 2 sizes in there?
Tak
I rarely venture into Facebook but I just did and got this “memory” from 12 (12!!!!!) years ago ❤️
"The thing I remember, aside from you sounding great, is thinking, “SHUT UP! My daughter is SINGING, you monsters!”"
Wow 😮  I’ll bet she can quickly hang level shelves too 🤔
What an amazing person!  Have you seen her play?
Took my frother out for the inaugural…frothing. This creamer is real dairy and has a bit of fat and sugar.  It didn’t foam up as much as I expected but it was quite tasty 😋❤️. 
*with coffee 
I did.  I’m not sure what the temperature was.  I just microwaved it for a bit.  Maybe it was too hot 🤔
Discovered what the problem is.  Old batteries 😒
Any issues with the USWNT Olympic roster?
Glad to see your neighbor in there
Versatility seems especially important with roster of 18
I was surprised by Casey Krueger only because I wasn’t as familiar with her 🤔
I need new batteries 😞
It was a roll of the dice from the start.  Speed was going up and down this morning and then slowed to a stop 😬
That’s weird.  I don’t want to get Louie in trouble but it looked like she knew what the answer was the whole time.
EXTRA POWER!
I’ll be frothing everything now🍷 
Just discovered the frother spins waaay faster than it did with the old batteries 👍 and the creamer I use just refuses to get very foamy.  
It’s a nice change 😋.  I’ve really enjoyed it.  I’ll try some milk at some point.
Very impressive effort from Austria.  I was hoping they could pull it off.
I watched France/Switzerland off and on until 80th minute when France was up 3-1 and cruising.  Then I turned it off 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
I had no idea what craziness I missed until I saw Kai Ryssdal tweet “Holy Crap”.
"Well, well, well 🧐.  Good hire for Tottenham imho.  How does Rey feel about it?"
Bruno Lage seems like an intriguing choice for Wolves
I only read a little about Bruno right after you sent that about Tottenham. I hadn’t heard that Wolves named a new coach.
Meeting with Dr Owens this morning so I’ll ask about the drops.  I’m sure you’ve seen articles like this.  Seems to work for a lot of people. Not covered by insurance (yet) but cost offset by savings in time/travel.

I’ll let you know what Dr Owens says 😘
What would be a good time to give you a call tonight?  Probably easier to tell you what Dr. Owens said than to text it.
"I was looking for info on allergy drops/tablets for pet dander and came across this place in Chicago.  I keep seeing things, including from this place, that say it can be successful for pet allergies, especially cats 🤷‍♂️"
That website has an annoying virtual assistant that pops up
🤨 un momento 
How bout this one?
Disclaimer:
Interesting info - not an endorsement 
"That’s great!  Lucky find - I wasn’t even looking for anything in Chicago, just general info 😁"
"Wow, that was quick! "
That’s really cool 😎.  It’s nice that you have access to that.  I need to get my bike setup working again although what I really need to do is get back outside with my bike.
Great workout and good for your knees 👍
Will do on both accounts 👍
It may be a little bit before I can ask about curex immunotherapy.  Dr. Owens is no longer at LMH.  She’s still technically my allergist but I don’t see her nearly as often.  I’m due for a review appointment with her so hopefully I can get in soon.

Strange that there isn’t much info out there 🤔
I’m also wondering about objectivity of doctors who make a lot of money from “standard” allergy injections 🤷‍♂️. I don’t know enough about it.
“Wednesday Fireworks” or
“Satur(Wednes)day Fireworks”
Yep 😣
"From what I’ve seen leading up to this I thought US wouldn’t be able to handle Mexico - quicker, better organized, more creative."

So far US is really sloppy and looks a little intimidated.
Dominating those corners has been the saving grace for US.  The entire back 3 of US makes me queasy 🤢
I guess they are kind of even in that way
Crazy entertaining game.  Always expect some sparks to fly when these 2 teams play but stuff from fans is inexcusable/embarrassing 
What’s your new address?
Tak 😘
Amazing!  How are people that smart 🤷‍♂️
I saw that.  And it all happens in the browser 🤦‍♂️
"Just saw this in the interview with the guy - “I don’t have any employees, and I’m still working on the project alone. In the beginning, I thought it’s a disadvantage. I didn’t want my customer to know I’m the only one working on this. I was afraid of their reaction when they would find out it’s only me using an old $500 notebook.”"
I saw this because I follow Alexi Murdoch.  I know you’re a fan but I haven’t seen/heard Kishi Bashi much. This really blew me away...just so beautiful.
What an insanely talented human
I’m a wreck 😢. I’ve just been pacing back and forth.  Devastating.
I was watching 😰
Players pretty quickly formed a wall to block the view and they mostly kept the camera away.  At one point they cut to a closer shot and it was terrifying and they cut away.  
It was disturbing and I wish I didn’t see it.  So relieved that his condition is stable and news is cautiously optimistic.
News must be better than what they’ve released.  Players are warming up to resume game 😳
The name for the new Crew (or whatever they’re called now) stadium is Lower.com field
🤢🤦‍♂️
"Yeah, lower dot com field 😒"
I just got some of this in an amount consistent with normal human consumption 
I was intrigued when I got an email promoting this as one of their “seasonal teas”.  I generally like citrus a lot.

Here’s my review after one cup:
"Smells and tastes like bubble gum 🤷‍♂️, which I’m not a fan of."

Mom thinks it smells and tastes like bubble gum too.
Will you need any more help moving?
It’s always a pain but it’ll be great when you get in there and enjoy the extra space and balcony ❤️. Pretty crazy that you and Spencer are moving at exactly the same time.  Across the country vs a couple of blocks 😄
I did not.  I like him a lot and would wish him great success but hoped that would come with Wolves 😞 
That can be such a killer for mid- level teams that are so close in talent but missing 1 or 2 key players. Hopefully the team as a whole isn’t feeling like we’ve taken this as far as we can go here. Competition is ruthless and players rightfully feel like their careers are so short and need to pursue every opportunity to be part of a winning team.
I hope it goes smoothly 😉
Glass is half full 👊
I agree completely.  The way the train is done seems a bit like a cheesy tshirt from a tourist shop.
"Disrespectful, demeaning 🤦‍♂️"
Are they worried that one game would damage the field?
Do they just view the Spirit as an annoyance?
I understand it’s a business thing  and I don’t know anything about that relationship but it seems a little too...something 
 I like it too 😊
"I got a notification from One Football that the Red Stars had scored.  Right when I went in to see who scored, they scored again 🤩. Maybe I should check more often."
Sometimes when text both of us it goes to Mom’s yahoo address 🤔
Same thing happened in March when we were there.  Maybe it’s something in my phone.
I think she did stop using that one
Enjoying my Beam Paints again 🎨😊
Quite a Champions League final
I’ve never a done a Peloton but similar things.  It’s cool that you can pick a course and it varies the tension/difficulty.  It can be a very good workout and a good change of pace from stuff you’re used to doing.  Did you do a class?
So competitive 
I would definitely do that pretty frequently if I had access to it and didn’t have to pay for it 😬

I know your rent covers it but that’s a nice option to have.  Good for your legs and knee obviously.
"Yes, indeed 👍 "
Check out what this app (Remini) does for blurry photos. Kind of hard to believe.
🤷‍♂️ mind boggling 
Have you received makeup and an assignment yet?
"Btw, I’m sorry I didn’t offer any feedback on the contract.  I’m sure I would not have been as helpful as Mom and Rachel 😬"
Do you know if the assignments will be pretty specific or more of an open-ended “just do what you do” kind of thing?
That makes sense.
"While I have you, how’s the twitchy eye?"
Very good news 😊
Just like you and Rey before you hurt your knee
"Pretentious and tone-deaf, imho"
😒
"As much as the new ownership screwed this up, the die-hard fans will be there and eventually move on.  This will linger though."
"Unfortunately for the Crew, they scrapped something that received very high praise and attention from soccer fans all over the world.  High bar to clear...again 🤷‍♂️"
Do you mean your eyes start to hurt?
"Hmm, I’m not sure what that is.  My only real eye strain issue is after I read for a long time my eyes sort of get stuck on that focus distance so things are blurry for a while when I stop reading and look up."

How long has that been going on?
Does it only happen when you’re staring at a screen as opposed to a book?
I mean just for the couple of days or has it happened before?
"I haven’t experienced the twitching thing more than a rare, brief occurrence.  Do you always have the headache with it?"
"Do you still experience it if you haven’t looked at your laptop for a couple of days, like over a weekend?"
"Looks like eye strain, stress, lack of sleep, etc. I know people who have migraines can have the twitchy eye thing.  Do you have a doctor (or eye doctor) you can consult if it doesn’t go away?"
"To me, it sounds like it’s related to staring at small type on your laptop for long periods of time.  I know you do something with the color temperature of your screen for night time but you might want to try something like this. These seem to make a difference for some people.  There are a bunch of them out there.  Warby Parker even has some."
American Academy of Ophthalmology says you don’t need the blue-blocking glasses and the problem is caused by overuse of digital devices. 🤷‍♂️🤔
Don’t we all? 🥺
"Definitely talk to an actual healthcare professional if it continues for long...and make a point of giving your eyes a break when you’re working.  Yeah, listen to me - do as I say, not as I do 😬"
How’s the twitchy eye?
Handful is less?
I must have helped by showing concern and asking a bunch of vague questions 🏅
Is it moving day?
Aah.  Moving is always a pain.  At least you don’t have decades of accumulated stuff in your basement 😬
Is there any kind of bet on the Tottenham/Wolves game tomorrow?
Is Rey giving you half a goal?  Or even a whole one?
Weird that they didn’t show it
No doubt 
I missed the second half.  Had to run to the store 😒. Rey spotted you 2 goals!? Awfully generous.
That pesky “if” 😒
Wolves usually don’t lack for chances (and other teams often steal their finishers 😬)
It is painfully close
Absolutely no freaking way 😳
He jogs up and casually nails a perfect header to the far post.  Just speechless 😶 
The technique was like a top striker who does it all the time.  Amazing 🤩 
Post game he said every once in a while
What’s going on with Red Stars?
"No, if you fill it within a few miles or even a little more, it’ll be fine.  I would just pick something that’s easy to get in and out of."
"This seems really promising!  I’ll have to ask Mom about insurance coverage.  I think I pay $11 copay each time I go in for shots, which is currently once/month.  Each time I need new serum there’s a chunk I pay that’s not covered.  It also took a long time ($) to build up to the point I’m at now so that’s also a big part of the equation."

I didn’t look closely enough at the website - are they saying this could eliminate your symptoms over time or you’re kind of committing to that $65/month forever?
Just saw this in FAQ:  

"“Physicians generally recommend that you stay on treatment for at least 3 years, to help achieve long lasting relief.”"

"I think that’s pretty consistent with what they say about shots, once you reach maintenance level."
It’s looking like a really good option to me so far
"3 years upfront 🤔. That’s kinda...something.  Are they thinking that will force people to stick with it, increasing their success rate?"
Interesting 🧐 
"Certainly would make sense to do the 3 years, if possible.  I would want to do some more research on it."
"Is it my imagination or did you have a smooth, efficient experience with Sixt?"
"Sorry, I changed topics 😬"
"I’ll have to remember that next time we need to rent.  I had heard good things about Sixt.  It’s a German company, which might have something to do with it.  I seem to remember seeing the at the Reykjavik airport.  I’ve had some really annoying experiences with Hertz and Avis."
Earl Grey Moonlight ☕️ 

1 teaspoon for 2 minutes?
Water boiled or lower temp?
Tak 😋
"Impressive results! I admit I would have had my doubts as to whether that would actually make a significant change, aside from drawing attention and getting people talking about it.  Kudos to Columbia!"
"🤩😎 I wonder if she told someone, “I just saw Emma Peterson at Trader Joe’s”?"
"She’s pretty tall, isn’t she?"
sneaky 
I was thinking the buildings you’ve been living in and looking at could be popular with players.
Makes sense to me for some reason 🤔
I’m a big fan of the earl gray moonlight 😋
That looks really good.  Have you made it yourself?  Do you need to foam the milk?
I definitely need to try that.  I like coffee lattes.  Not sure about the lavender either 🤔 
What is this 🤷‍♂️. Who’s doing what?
"Aah, I didn’t understand.  I thought a team was moving.  I’m very slow today.  I can understand the desire to do the whole refresh with a new stadium and all but what they created when they moved away from dudes in hard hats was really good.  I’m a little disappointed by this now that I think about it 🤔"
*is really good
If they’re replacing the circle/checkerboard/‘96 stuff I’m not happy about it at all.  I don’t know anything about it obviously but I think that would be a big misstep by new ownership.
Rosie’s pretty happy to be home
She certainly is 😴 
"Here’s the monitor I was talking about, with standard keyboard for size reference.  Height is easily adjusted, of course.  Like I said, it’s all yours if this size works for you (27in diagonal)."
It does not have a built in camera
Sold!
It’s a win win.  You get to see everybody cheering during your presentations and I don’t have to mess with eBay 👏
"On the treadmill today I was watching a documentary about Keith Richards (Rolling Stones).  He was talking about the influence that Chicago blues had on him and they showed this place that Mom and I walked past on Monday morning.  He said “2120 Michigan Avenue.  I’ll always remember that address”.  I had no idea we walked past such a legendary recording studio.  So much amazing music was recorded there, including “At Last” by Etta James.  They also showed shots of Keith Richards talking and playing pool with Buddy Guy at Legends in 2015. 😎"
Right down the road from you!!

Neighborhood where US Soccer Federation is located is pretty cool too.
I’d like to read more about the Clarke house and the whole Prairie District
Aaaahhhh 😩. I really hate hearing things like this.  Makes my heart (and my knee) ache. 
"There’s soooo much pressure to get them back on the field, including from the athlete.  "
np We figured that was the case.
Just saw that
Who’s showing the game?
Where’s that team from?
Just heard - Nicaragua 
I’ll send more later but pretty uneventful so far.  Spent most of the time just walking together on leash.
Unbelievable 😩🤦‍♂️
I had seen that he went out of that game with an injury but didn’t see any detail.  
"I know it’s part of the game but it’s so disappointing, as a fan, to be denied the opportunity to watch these top players in their prime.  "
Hmm 🤔.  Similar thing happened when Liverpool lost Jota for a couple of months.
I’m animating stuff being threaded through the carotid artery and down into the heart 🤢
"This does raise some questions I hadn’t considered.  Are you, or are you not, the REAL Emma Peterson?"
"Well, that makes sense"
Do you want that flier from aerie?
I hadn’t seen it.  I think I like it overall although I feel like the logo/badge isn’t quite there for me.  Seems like it needs something 🤷‍♂️
I guess it’s not much different than using The Big Apple FC or Windy City FC 🤔
"Oh, definitely 👍"
"Hey if you’re ever in the mood for something very interesting, but also depressing, check out the Sam Cooke documentary on Netflix called “The two killings of Sam Cooke”.  Phenomenal voice and another enormous talent stolen from us.  Another Chicago connection as well."
"That might actually be a deal breaker.  That’s an early watch model that, if I’m not mistaken, does not have cell capability, meaning it has to be tethered to the phone (close proximity) to function like a phone."

"Kind of defeats the purpose of having it for many situations.  Having said all that, we need to confirm that is the case with that watch."
I could certainly be wrong.  Can you look up the model number?  Could be a wrong assumption on my part.
Quick search shows $10/month to add Apple Watch to TMobile plan.
I did find this.  I think most of the models came in either GPS or GPS + cellular.  I think the first version required the phone to be nearby.  The one you have may be GPS only.
😠 We should trade it in if that’s possible 
Do you have the Apple Watch app on your phone and does it recognize the watch?
Version and model numbers are unnecessarily confusing 
So it is gps only I’m assuming 
Mara’s foster parent just left Mara with us.  Mom’s out walking Rosie and Mara now.

It was pretty emotional for Elisha to leave Mara.
It was emotional for Mara too 😕
This isn’t much but here they are getting treats side by side 
Post walk and wrestling 
Is this the tea you like?
One more car rental thing - you have to return it with a full tank.  They push pre-paying for a full or half tank to save you the inconvenience of having to stop at a gas station right before dropping it off.

That tends to be very expensive so I always decline that and plan for time to stop before turning it in.

If you already knew all of this stuff...I was never here 🤫
Mom’s home!
Liverpool is hurting my feelings 
I’m a Cubs and Bears fan 😒 
That corner apartment at Paragon (?) looks nice.  Is that available or are they just showing it off?
Here are my new glasses in their peaceful resting place ❤️
And here’s Rosie as a triangle 
"At what point did you say, “ My mom is out of control”?  When you received the difficult to find cookies or when she told you about her extensive cookie sleuth skills? She is out of control."
Which? What?
"Yeah, that stings a little more 😬"
I thought it was too
I think it was one of those that would have been tough to argue against had he called it
Pretty awful injury curse on Wolves ant Liverpool this season 
And
I didn’t see what happened.  Coady’s knee hit him?
I was wondering if they had even shown a replay
I really thought Wolves were going to score when play started up again
"No, ignore it.  I read something about that a while ago.  Some kind of scam, I think. I’ll have to look it up again 🤔"
I’ll listen to it later.  When did this happen?
It’s especially depressing knowing that her experience is probably far too common.  
"I just listened to the interview with Lindsey Horan.  I have a lot of respect for her for sharing her story.  Seems like, ultimately, the experience made her mentally stronger and I imagine the French coaches would say that validates the way they treated her, that it had the desired effect.  But it could have gone horribly wrong with lasting harm, both mentally and physically."

"Not to mention the fact that I don’t think they were trying to toughen her up.  They were trying to make her fit their image of “skinny and beautiful”.  It’s a testament to Lindsey that she’s gotten to where she is in spite of going through what she did as an 18 year old, living in a different country and trying to compete on a world class level."

"I also respect the fact that she gives the coach credit for helping develop her on-field ability, while at the same time talking about how painful the other part of it still is for her and that it should have been handled very differently."

Thanks for sharing that with me
🤗
"Completely agree, especially since she was playing well and beat everyone on the team in the fitness test during that time"
I just looked up Lindsey to see how old she is and saw that she scored 48 goals in 58 games for PSG 😳
Just made this from the book Spencer gave Mom a couple of years ago.  Quite tasty 😋. I think you guys would like it.  I added roasted pistachios at the end instead of pine nuts and also halved grape tomatoes (not in the recipe but added great color and flavor). It’s the kind of thing that could be easily adapted with different veggies. 😘
We still have a couple of hours to go.  I’m thinking you guys should go ahead and eat when you’re ready.  Looks like it’ll start raining there around that time too.  
"Oops, sent before I meant to.  I was going to say I’d like to avoid walking to the hotel in pouring rain again.  We’ve been driving through pouring rain for a while.  It’s icky."
We are dodging all of the cats and the dogs
Hmm 🤔 
Looked like a beautiful walk you had today 😍.   I wish we could have done that instead of drive all day.

"While I’m thinking of it, and no rush, can you send me a picture(s) of the outputs/ports on your work laptop when you get a chance?  I want to make sure I know what cable will be needed."
Tell Rey to start warming up.  I might put him in for Bale in the second half.
I didn’t have it on but I saw that they just scored
Again
This is the team that knocked them out of last World Cup if I’m not mistaken 
Happy birthday 🎉🎂 
Have a great day! I love you ❤️ 
Now I want a milkshake 😒
Mom’s taking Rosie for a walk in the snow.  See how excited Rosie is to wear the light-up collar you got her.
I see you have quite a storm coming your way.  Are you properly bundled and stocked with necessities?
8-12 😳.  We’re supposed to get 6-9 and not nearly as cold as Chicago 🥶 
Some people have tweeted about this so you may have seen it.  Kind of a fun way to bounce around the world listening to local radio stations.

Our 6-9 in of snow ended up being 3-4 in of freezing rain and snow 😒
Liverpool’s season 😞
That’s crazy 😝 
"You’re going to think I’m making this up but this actually happened. I played in a game in high school where the other team was awarded a PK and the ref positioned himself close to the goal line just outside the goal.  The guy’s shot went wide of the goal, hit the ref, and went into the goal.  Goal was awarded because ref is “part of the field”."
😳😡🤡
We did not
"Yes, that’s really cool!  I’ve taken 3 or 4 of their courses and want to take more.  They are legendary and very highly thought of in my world.  That’s impressive.  I know the people they hire are top notch, as they say."
"No, that’s so painful to hear when that happens to a pro who works so hard to get and stay where they are.  That’s very disappointing to say the least.  "

I took some solace in the fact that I didn’t tear mine during high school or college when playing was so important to me.

For players at that level? Crushing blow 😩
"I think it comes down to style of play and a little bit of genetics.  Soccer (and other sports) puts so much twisting torque on a knee.  Unless every player wore a brace all of the time, I’m not sure how much more can be done.  Van dijk’s I still blame on Pickford 100% 😠"
I’m still plotting my revenge 
Did you see these?
I took this yesterday but Mike seems concerned about Rey
Sounds very tasty 😋 
"No, I’m working 😒"
Forgot about it.

"Not good, I take it "
Oh man ☹️. That’s awful.
I just turned it on and saw that they were playing again 

That’s frightening 
"Yeah, very surprised by that.  "
Nice to hear Ian Darke’s voice again.  I don’t think I’ve seen a game that he was doing for a while.
Ian Darke is my favorite I think.  He’s done a lot of World Cup games including women’s games (with Julie Foudy).
This game is jinxed
Wolfs 👏
It was 😬
I’m hoping for no injuries (and 3 points 😬)
Gotta keep up with Tottenham.  I’m struggling with their success.    I like the players a lot but there’s the obvious threat to Liverpool and rooting against Jose Mourhino has always been a big part of my EPL experience 😬.  
Tough to beat.  I love the way they play and work with each other 😍. They are fun to watch.
I like the Wolves jerseys.  Have they worn those before?
Peacock Premium finally got me with a 30% off for the first 3 months deal 😐
Wolves player definitely anticipated contact.  Pretty amazing awareness and body control on Mane’s part to pull his foot back.  That one camera angle was perfect.  Phew 😅 (sorry)
I wish I could rewind the streaming stuff
"I completely agree with what Robbie Mustoe just said about the way refs are calling it and using VAR, it’s encouraging players to go well now I don’t have to finish my text.  I’m too slow 😞"
Very nice goal though 😬
A fan wearing Chicago Bears hat
I’m assuming you saw that the Crew made it to MLS Cup?  I caught the last 10 min of the game.  I have to admit I didn’t even know they were still in it 😬
Harrison Affel seems to be the only guy who’s been around for a while
Are you familiar with a singer who goes by “Cloves”?
Another one that came up in a playlist I was listening to 👍
Are you watching MLS Cup?
Crew has looked really good
"Quick to the ball, quick to recover "
Agreed
Liverpool looks like the team fighting (not very hard) to avoid relegation 🤦‍♂️
Yeah but shh 🤫 
I thought for sure it would be overruled 
What a game for your Wolves!
I like him a lot.  Always seems to make things happen.  
I was mostly listening while I worked and was surprised to hear “the young American” 🤷‍♂️
Yesterday morning ❄️😍
You certainly can 👍
"That reminds me, I haven’t done an eye design for you 😞"
You might want to bring some of your Earl Grey Cream ☕️ 

We only have lowly 
regular Earl Grey
There’s a red plaid wrapped box on the baker’s cupboard thing.  Could you do me a favor and put that in the mailbox for the mail carrier?
I believe that’s the one. Tak.
Can’t think of anything 
?
We must not have used it for quite a while.  Didn’t recognize it 🤷‍♂️
Traore draws the PK.  Wolves go up 3-1.
Wolves have looked good 👍
It was one of those where he realized his foot was touched a split second after the contact. Then both feet were instantly stuck in concrete and he went down.  You can see in the second picture where the defender had pulled his foot away and then the guy went down.  There was contact but 🤔🤔🤔
Otasawie had a golden opportunity in the final second 😞
"Watching USWNT, I assume?"
I’m watching.  Rosie thought Mom could use some help coloring her hair 🤷‍♂️
I’m telling
She is.  I kept reading great things but had never seen her play.
A lot of competition for those 18 Olympic roster spots
"Correction - Mom was NOT coloring her hair, just washing 😬"
Granted Man Utd is playing great now but Liverpool’s collapse over the last few weeks is killing me
